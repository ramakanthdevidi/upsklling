   Power shell basics:
*Windows PowerShell commands, called (cmdlets).

*The first step is to go to the (Get-Help) command which gives you an explanation about how to give a command and its parameter.

*The latest version of PowerShell is 5.0 and to check what is installed in our server we type the following command   :($PSVersionTable) or to check the version we can use (get-host)

*after checking the version we have to update the help document (update-help)

*to see how many commands in system we use (get-command) 


*If we want to search any thing suppose we want service consist of command then we can use like (get-command "service") if we want count of it then we can use (get-command "service).count
