                       LINUX

ps -ef : give the process that are running

set -x  #debug mode 

set -e #exits the scripts when there is an error , so there is drawback in it so we use set -o like if pipeling is used it wont identify the pipefilures

set -o pipefail when we use this the script stops there and show the errors.








              create a file:
 
*how to create a file-using  cat commands like this : cat > f1
here f1 file is created
*to view the file: cat f1
*to remove file: rm f1
to come out file we use ctrl d
*2nd way to create a file is using touch command:touch f2
touch comand for empty files
ls:list all files.
 
  file and directory haveing three types of permission:
 
  read--r
  write--w
  execute--x
 
we are having 9 char of permissions
 
        - - -     - - -          - - -
        woner-u     group-g          other-o
 
changing the permission: we use chmod
here r is represnted with 4
w--2
x--1
total 7
 
example chmod 764 file1
here we are giving permission according to that 3 categories
 
+ give permission'
- removes the permission
 
ex:chmod u+w f6
here we are giving write permissions to owner

              create a directory: like folder
 
 
*mkdir d1:creating
rmdir d1:removing ,if it is empty
other wise rm -r d1

     HOW TO CREATE ONE DIRECTORY IN OTHER
 
 
mkdir d1
cd d1
mkdir d2
cd d2

 
 
cd.. allows you to go previous directory
 
            How to identify which is file and directory
 
* by colors blue indicates directory.
if there is no colors then we use ls -l where we can see all details there starting from d indicates directory
or  starting from - indicates file.
 
to get more info go for ls -l
in linux if file name starts with .(dot) its a hidden directory or file ex: touch .f1
so if want to see that hidden use ls -a
if we want to copy file we use cp ex: cp f1 f2
 


 
Linux commands :
ls -lrt
gives the details of file name as well as permissions
with that we can open the file by cat file name
 
 
                                                    Introduction to awk command/Script
 
it is used for text processing.
 
if we want to print any third line second line for that type we use awk.
awk is used like 
1.a command 
2.A scripting language.
 
--The awk command is programming language ,which requires no compiling ,and allows the user to use variables,numeric functions sting function and logical operaters.
The Awk Command in Unix is just like Scripting language which is used for text processing 
Awk Command in Unix is most important command used to find nd replace the text.
it consider each line as records and in each record consist of fields
by default field as separate by space
we can change the separator by -F
awk has it won predefined variables like $0,$1... $n and NR,Nf
Sysntax:
 
awk options 'pattern {action}' filename
command|awk options 'pattern {action}'
 
* patteren:matching word or condition
*options:-f fs To specify a filed separator
-v va=value To declare a variable
action is a logic
$0 means entire file will disaply
$1 and so and is to display the particulacolumnmn
 
awk '{print $1}filenameme
here it will print couloumn 1 from that file.
if we want to add any thing that back of coloumn then
awk '{ print $1 "my name is }' file name
-->NR : no of records,gives output with recoerd no.
-->NF:how many fileds we have 
it all should write in brackets
if we write $ NF last filed will display notrmal nf means not lastfield only no of fields
 
 
                          SED command 


what is sed :it an editor used to work on stream of data
sed stands for stream of editor.
viewing file content
Searching
find and replace
insertion or deletion
it also supports regular expression.
Adavntages of sed over vi/vim editors:
editfiles without opening it.
 
 
Syntax for sed command:

sed[options] 'commands' file -to-work-with-sed
 
viewing file content with sed command
sed -n 'p' file.txt is used for printing file content one time here with out -n it wil print two times
if we want to print all file contetwe can use that above and also :sed "" file.txt.
sed -n '3p' file.txt:it will 3rd line no
like so on by replceing no it will print that.
sed -n '3,10p' file.txt:it will print 3rd line to 10th line
sed -n '30,$p' file.txt:it will print form 30 to last line whatever for that we use $p
sed -n '1~3p' file.txt:it will print 1,4,7---- lines
IF WE ARE USING P FOR PRINT THEN WE USE -N FOR THAT BECAUSE IF WE NOT USE -N IT WILL PRINT 2 times.
 
 
DELETE in sed
 
for print we used p here we use d for that 
EX:sed '4,$d' file.txt
here it deletes 4th to last it only prints the 1 to 3
 
here if we delete also the original file content does not change '
only while displaying it shows 
so if i want to change the original file informatoion
for thatwe use sed -i '10,$d' file.txt
we can craete backup for it usinfg:sed -i .back '3,$d' file.txt

 
SEARCHING WITH SED":
if we want a line that has particular word we go for searching
Ex: sed -n '/if/p' file.txt
we get lines which are having if.
when ever we want use  multiple opton line sto print we use -e
ex:sed -n -e "/if/p" -e "/who/p" file.txt
 
FIND AND REPLACE WITH SED COMMAND :
 
for that we use s
ex:sed 's/root/udaemy/' file.txt
here root is replaced with udeymy here only first occurance will be replaced 
if we want toreplace all areas means we use g key word globally key word.
ex:sed 's/root/udaemy/g' file.txt
